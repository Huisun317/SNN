## A classic HJB example

Since our work is under the framework of stochastic control which is intimately related to the HJB equation, we show that it is natural to solve the HJB equation through our approach.
We use the standard HJB example in the classical paper (Jiequn Han, Arnulf Jentzen Weinan E https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02568.pdf)


The mathematical setup of the problem, the exact solution and the design of our algorithm strategy are all included in the code.
