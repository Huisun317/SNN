## Training on CIFAR10 dataset
We show that our neural network achieves 93~94% (which is human level accuracy) test accuracy on CIFAR10 dataset in 30 epochs. One can fine tune the 
neural network/parameters etc. to achieve better results. 

Simply fix 
$$\sigma = 0$$ or one can set it to a small constant to obtain similar results.
