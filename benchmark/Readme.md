This folder contains comparison between the training results of SNN under the Stochastic Maximum Principle procedure and the classical feed-forward method. 
The observation is that the SNN structure under SMP will result in faster convergence. 
For MNIST handwritten digits, we have the following test accuracy on the testset.
